Comprehensive_ISO_Location_Codes

This project joins together the location codes from 2 different 
data sources so that as many as possible can be compiled together into a simple format. 
For example, certain data sources don't contain the principalities of the 
United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales, Nothern Ireland etc) and other
data sources have ambiguity between regional and sub-regional codes, which can be confusing.
